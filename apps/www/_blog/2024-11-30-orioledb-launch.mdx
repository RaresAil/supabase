# OrioleDB public alpha

Today, we're releasing the public alpha of [OrioleDB](https://www.orioledb.com/) on the Supabase platform.

### What’s OrioleDB?

OrioleDB is a **storage extension** which uses Postgres' pluggable storage system. It’s designed to be a drop-in replacement for Postgres’ default Heap storage.

You can read more about OrioleDB here [TODO - LINK TO orioledb.com post] and learn why you might choose it over the default Postgres storage engine.

### Limitations

This initial release is a public alpha and you should _not_ use it for Production workloads. The release comes with several limitations:

- The release is restricted to Free organizations. You will not be able to upgrade OrioleDB projects to larger instance sizes. If you want to run OrioleDB on a larger instance we suggest following the [Getting Started](https://www.orioledb.com/docs/usage/getting-started) guide on OrioleDB’s official website.
- This release only supports the Postgres default B-Tree index type. It is not compatible with other built-in indexs like GIN/GiST, or indexes provided by extensions such as pgvector's HNSW.

### Should you use it today?

At this stage, the goal of adding OrioleDB to the platform is to make it easier for testers to give feedback. If you’re running production workloads, stick to the standard options available.

### Getting started and more info

TODO - update instructions
To get started today, go to [database.new](http://database.new) and you can choose “OrioleDB” as a Region when launching a new database. If you want to learn more about OrioleDB and the vision for the future, check out the blog post the OrioleDB team released today. [TODO - LINK TO orioledb.com post]
